TASK_A_NOTES = """
It's interesting, than model reported that both pubs works, and after that proceed to another tool call.
I'd expect before that, model will explicitly outline the choice.
Now, choice is being retrieved from tool call parameters.

Also, during one of my runs I got 4 tool calls (one check_pub_availability, while expected 2).
Unfortunately, I didn't store log, but this might mean that model ignored instructions or optimized plan 
(checks would be sequential), i.e. proceed to second pub only if first don't meet criteria.

# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".

Tool implements graceful degradation stability pattern, so if real image generation failed (e.g. model deprecation),
then we fallback to placeholder generation.

None of the known Edinburgh venues can accommodate 300 people while meeting all requirements. The maximum capacities are:

I don't have access to real-time train schedules or transportation data. For the most accurate information about the last train from Edinburgh Waverley to London, I recommend checking:
1. The National Rail website (https://www.nationalrail.co.uk)
2. Train service apps like Citymapper or Trainline
3. The specific train operator's website (e.g., LNER)

Our booking assistant is here for booking, we can't have tools for everything, e.g. what if user asks about last flight
to London instead of train, etc. Moreover it seems out of scope.
The fallback response seems friendly, reasonable and helpful, proposed services and apps would actually help users
to find train schedule by themselves.
However, depending on policies, we might safe guard answer with "Sorry, I can't help you with that"

LangGraph is simple graph with agent bidirectionally connected to tools (loop). Thus, agents decides if it's time 
to provide the answer (break the loop) or call another tool(s) to gather additional information.
Rasa CALM describes more complex structure with all possible "flows", how task can be executed. It's deterministic
which steps and in what order will be executed. For LangGraph in opposite we don't know how many and which tools will
be used, though "loop" architecture is universal.
